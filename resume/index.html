                <h2>BINGI ROHITH</h2>
                <p> Hello!My name is Rohith i myself think i was ordinary person with an extraordinary dream and i was an college dropout.Even though i had an excellent percentage in 10th and 12th class i left my studies because after my 12th i didn't got an computer science based branch in btech i got an electrical based branch,i never interested in electrical branch and due to my financial problems it was even became very hard to concentrate on my studies,so in my 3rd year i left my studied and joined a job to help my family financial issues.After some days the job i joined was not suited for me and i thought of joining a computer based course and get a job.I had an hobby of reading or knowing about techy news that helped me and  i got a path that can fullfill my dream job so,i joined SKILL SAFARI full stack web development course in it.The way they are helping out was good and their teaching was awesome.So i completed my course and now iam ready for my Job. </p>
